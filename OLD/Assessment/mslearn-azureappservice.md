## Open ended questions

1. Describe how App Service plans impact the scalability of an app. 


    <details>
    <summary>Show answer</summary>
    Scaling up in App Service means the virtual machine the app is running on will have more processing power and higher performance. Apps in App Service can be scaled up, or scaled down (less processing power), by adjusting the pricing tier of the plan.
    </details>

    <br>


2. What are some of the advantages of using the built-in authentication in Azure App Service?



    <details>
    <summary>Show answer</summary>
    The built-in authentication doesnâ€™t require any particular programming language, security expertise, or any code to utilize. App Service uses federated identity with many identity providers like Facebook, Google, and Twitter available by default. You can also use any OpenID Connect provider. 
    </details>

    <br>



3. You can set up rules (called conditions) in App Service to automate scaling an app out and in. Describe how App Service evaluates those rules. What types of metrics can be included in the rules?


    <details>
    <summary>Show answer</summary>
     When evaluating rules App Service evaluates the chosen metrics across all instances of the app. For example, if CPU utilization is one of the metrics used to determine if a change in scaling is needed, App Service will aggregate the CPU utilization for all instances of the app across a period of time known as the time grain. App service will perform the autoscale operation if the aggregated number meets the conditions in the rule.

4. What are web app deployment slots and how can they be used?

    <details>
    <summary>Show answer</summary>
    Deployment slots allow your app to run different instances. For example, a staging instance and a production instance. Deployment slots are live apps with their own hostnames. Deployment slots help you validate changes before making the app live. Slots also avoid a cold start which eliminates downtime. Lastly, slots let you fall back to a known good site.
