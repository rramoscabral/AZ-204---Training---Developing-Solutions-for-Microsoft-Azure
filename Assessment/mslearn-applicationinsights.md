1. How do you instrument an app to work with Application Insights?

    <details>
    <summary>Show answer</summary>
    You install a small instrumentation package (SDK) in your application or enable Application Insights using the Application Insights Agent when supported. The instrumentation monitors your app and directs the telemetry data to an Azure Application Insights Resource using a unique GUID that we refer to as an Instrumentation Key.
